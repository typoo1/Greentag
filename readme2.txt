These files represent the Default config for Speedtag V2.3 and later. The first 3 lines of the Default.txt are only to show the correct formatting for the lines that follow.
Default.txt is free to be edited by any IT user in the "g-SEA IT ALL" group.
As a backup, MASTER.Docx has been created as a mirror and locked from editing so the format cannot be lost.
In the even that the Default.txt config is damaged somehow, simply copy the whole of MASTER.Docx into Default.txt to restore it.
